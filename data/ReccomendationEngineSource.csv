Content Rating : Ages 13+

GraphicAudio® A Movie in Your Mind® proudly releases THE WAY OF KINGS the first of ten planned titles in New York Times Bestselling author Brandon Sanderson’s epic fantasy series THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE.

Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells trees pull in branches and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.

It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Wars were fought for them and won by them. One such war rages on the Shattered Plains. There Kaladin has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.

Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother the late king he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant he has begun to doubt his own sanity.

Across the ocean an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic Dalinar's niece Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

Director Rose Supan says “Brandon Sanderson is at the top of his game with THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVES. It's an honor to direct this story. The actors as well as our production team are thrilled to be a part of the process as well. I can proudly proclaim that the listener is in for a truly immersive experience!”

Six years ago the Assassin in White a hireling of the inscrutable Parshendi assassinated the Alethi king on the very night a treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi.

Now the Assassin is active again murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.

Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren Syl.

Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.

Meanwhile at the heart of the Shattered Plains the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks their numbers ever shrinking they are convinced by their war leader Eshonai to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike indeed for Roshar itself are as dangerous as they are incalculable.

The Transgender Issue: An Argument for Justice,TheTransgenderIssue:AnArgumentforJustice,ShonFaye,ShonFaye,,SocialScience,THE INSTANT SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'Few books are as urgent as Shon Faye's debut ... Faye has hope for the future - and maybe so should we' Independent 'Unsparing important and weighty ... a vitally needed antidote' Observer 'A moving and impressively comprehensive overview of trans life' Vogue Trans people in Britain today have become a culture war 'issue'. Despite making up less than one per cent of the country's population they are the subjects of a toxic and increasingly polarized 'debate' which generates reliable controversy for newspapers and talk shows. This media frenzy conceals a simple fact: that we are having the wrong conversation a conversation in which trans people themselves are reduced to a talking point and denied a meaningful voice. In this powerful new book Shon Faye reclaims the idea of the 'transgender issue' to uncover the reality of what it means to be trans in a transphobic society. In doing so she provides a compelling wide-ranging analysis of trans lives from youth to old age exploring work family housing healthcare the prison system and trans participation in the LGBTQ+ and feminist communities in contemporary Britain and beyond. The Transgender Issue is a landmark work that signals the beginning of a new healthier conversation about trans life. It is a manifesto for change and a call for justice and solidarity between all marginalized people and minorities. Trans liberation as Faye sees it goes to the root of what our society is and what it could be; it offers the possibility of a more just free and joyful world for all of us.

It operates outside the narrow coverage of trans people in the mainstream and lays bare the inarguable facts' New Statesman 'Monumental and utterly convincing - crystal clear in its understanding of how the world should be' Judith Butler

============================
Approximate Running Time : 7 Hours

Content Rating : Ages 13+

In Oathbringer the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.

Dalinar Kholin’s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm which now sweeps the world with destruction and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.

Nestled in the mountains high above the storms in the tower city of Urithiru Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar’s blood-soaked past and stand together—and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past—even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.

The Way of Kings,TheWayofKings,BrandonSanderson,MichaelKramer KateReading,TheStormlightArchive Standard,Fantasy Epic Action&Adventure,From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson The Way of Kings Book One of the Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion. Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells trees pull in branches and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There Kaladin who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense where ten armies fight separately against a single foe he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother the late king he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic Dalinar's niece Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning writing and world-building The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive a bold masterpiece in the making. Speak again the ancient oaths: Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before Destination. and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again.

Dalinar Kholin challenged the evil god Odium to a contest of champions with the future of Roshar on the line. The Knights Radiant have only ten days to prepare-and the sudden ascension of the crafty and ruthless Taravangian to take Odium's place has thrown everything into disarray. Desperate fighting continues simultaneously worldwide-Adolin in Azimir Sigzil and Venli at the Shattered Plains and Jasnah at Thaylen City. The former assassin Szeth must cleanse his homeland of Shinovar from the dark influence of the Unmade. He is accompanied by Kaladin who faces a new battle helping Szeth fight his own demons . . . and who must do the same for the insane Herald of the Almighty Ishar. At the same time Shallan Renarin and Rlain work to unravel the mystery behind the Unmade Ba-Ado-Mishram and her involvement in the enslavement of the singer race and in the ancient Knights Radiants killing their spren. And Dalinar and Navani seek an edge against Odium's champion that can be found only in the Spiritual Realm where memory and possibility combine in chaos. The fate of the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.

For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler the ""Sliver of Infinity"" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror divinely invincible. Then when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained a terribly scarred heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.

Mistborn: Secret History,Mistborn:SecretHistory,BrandonSanderson,MichaelKramer KateReading,Mistborn,Action&Adventure Epic Dystopian Fantasy,Note: This novella is included in Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection now available in print ebook and audiobook from Tor (US/Canada) and Gollancz (UK/Commonwealth). Mistborn: Secret History is a companion story to the original Mistborn Trilogy. As such it contains huge spoilers for the books Mistborn (The Final Empire) The Well of Ascension and The Hero of Ages. It also contains very minor spoilers for the book The Bands of Mourning. Mistborn: Secret History builds upon the characterization events and worldbuilding of the original trilogy. Reading it without that background will be a confusing process at best. In short this isn’t the place to start your journey into Mistborn. (Though if you have read the trilogy—but it has been a while—you should be just fine so long as you remember the characters and the general plot of the books.) Saying anything more here risks revealing too much. Even knowledge of this story’s existence is in a way a spoiler. There’s always another secret.

Don’t trust their false peace.” That is the warning that Alanik of the planet ReDawn gave the human pilot Spensa after Alanik’s ship crash-landed on Detritus. While accepting an invitation to meet with her people’s enemy the Galactic Superiority Alanik heard Spensa’s cry for help across the vastness of space and she used her cytonic powers to hyperjump her ship to the source of that cry. What she found there was a shock—a whole planet of free humans fighting against the Superiority. Were they the allies her people desperately needed? When she recovered from her injuries and met the friendly humans Jorgen and FM of Skyward Flight she found that her warning to Spensa had gone unheeded by the government of Detritus and they were considering a peace overture from the Superiority. Now having returned to ReDawn Alanik is dismayed to learn that her own people are falling into the exact same trap. The faction in ReDawn’s government that wants to appease the Superiority has gained the upper hand. With Alanik’s mentor Renakin captured she has no one to turn to but Jorgen FM and their friend Rig.

Midnight Tides,MidnightTides,StevenErikson,MichaelPage,MalazanBookoftheFallen,Fantasy Epic,After decades of warfare the tribes of the Tiste Edur have at last united under the rule of the Warlock King. But peace has been exacted at a terrible price - a pact made with a hidden power whose motives are at best suspect at worst deadly. To the south the expansionist kingdom of Lether has devoured all of its less-civilised neighbours with rapacious hunger. All save one - the Tiste Edur. But Lether is approaching a long-prophesied renaissance that it will take it from a kingdom and lost colony to an empire reborn - and has fixed its gaze on the rich lands of the Tiste Edur. It would seem inevitable that the tribes will surrender succumbing to the suffocating weight of gold or to slaughter at the edge of a sword. Or so Destiny has decreed. A pivotal treaty between the two sides nears but unknown ancient forces are awakening. For the impending struggle between these two peoples is but a pale reflection of an altogether more profound primal battle - a confrontation driven by a still-raw betrayal and a craving for vengeance. War and confrontation magic and myth collide in this the stunning fifth chapter in Steven Erikson's magnificent The Malazan Book of the Fallen - a series hailed as an epic of the imagination and a classic work of high fantasy.
